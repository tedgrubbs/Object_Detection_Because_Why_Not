# Object_Detection_Because_Why_Not
My attempt at implementing YOLOv1 from scratch using just Pytorch and numpy. I have implemented the loss function from scratch which has been the hardest part.

Network is easily configurable but more options are needed to make things more customizable.

An experimentation dataset is included to make sure everything is running correctly. The network just has to look at an image of simple rectangles and learn to detect those. This dataset is created with "Build_Square_Dataset.py".
